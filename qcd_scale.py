class qcdScaleWeightProducer:
    """The nine muR/muF scale weights as an indexed shape-weight source.

    Stored whole, like the PDF members: each entry gets its own anaCache denominator and
    its own weight_base_qcd_scale_muR<r>_muF<f>_rel, and which of them form the envelope is
    decided later, per bin. Being shape-only, they complement the QCD_scale_* rate lnN.

    The scale is the (muR, muF) pair the entry stands for, not its position in the vector,
    so the branch says what it varies. `0p5` spells 0.5 because a column name cannot carry
    a dot, and no label ends in Up or Down, which splitSystName would cut at.

    Entry 4 is not stored as a member. It is the nominal, and where it is not 1 it carries
    the same leftover factor as PDF member 0 (see qcd_scale.h). That factor has to enter
    weight_base exactly once: when pdf is active it comes from pdf's Central, and the
    members are divided by entry 4 so it is not counted again; when pdf is not active
    nothing else carries it, so entry 4 becomes this producer's Central and the members
    are taken as stored. Either way entry 4 is a divisor or the Central, never a variation.

    Rows that FuseAnaTuples padded carry an empty vector and are skipped, as in pdf.py.
